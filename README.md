# Comparative Analysis of FEWS NET and IPC food insecurity data in Somalia

This repository contains the preprocessing and analysis code supporting the paper:

**Food Insecurity Projections for Anticipatory Action: A Comparative Spatiotemporal Analysis of FEWS NET and the IPC in Somalia**

The workflow harmonizes FEWS NET and IPC acute food insecurity classifications,
generates comparable time series, aggregates results to admin 2 districts,
and performs both descriptive comparison and projection skill assessment.

---

## Usage

To reproduce all analyses:

1. Open the R project file  
   `agile2026_food_insecurity_anticipatory_action.Rproj`
   (R version ≥ 4.2.0 is required).

2. Open the script  
   `scripts/Master_script.R`.

3. Run the master script.  
   This will:
   - load all required libraries,
   - run the full preprocessing pipeline for FEWS NET and IPC data,
   - execute all comparative analyses and skill assessment,
   - generate all figures, maps, and output files necessary to reproduce results.

All outputs are written to the `figs/` and `data/outputs/` directories, that are created in the master script.

## Script overview

### Preprocessing

**FEWS NET**
- `FEWSNET_1_geom_join.R`  
  Prepares FEWS NET data and links classifications to spatial reference units.
- `FEWSNET_2_ts_building.R`  
  Generates time series on monthly and assessment period level.
- `FEWSNET_3_adm2_join.R`  
  Aggregates FEWS NET time series to admin-2 districts.

**IPC**
- `IPC_1_data_merging.R`  
  Merges IPC current and projection datasets.
- `IPC_2_ts_building.R`  
  Generates time series on monthly and assessment period level.
- `IPC_3_adm2_join.R`  
  Aggregates IPC time series to admin-2 districts.

### Analysis

- `Analysis_1_comparison.R`  
  Comparative analysis of FEWS NET and IPC current assessments and projections over the period 2017-2025.
- `Analysis_2_skillassessment.R`  
  Projection skill assessment, including bias metrics and error timelines.
